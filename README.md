# dpd_crime_near_shooting
There were at least 813 alleged crimes in the two blocks around Tuesdayâ€™s shooting since 2018, according to a 9Wants to Know review of Denver Police Department data. Most of the documented alleged crimes near 20th Street and Market were assaults and thefts. Alleged crimes are becoming more common in the vicinity. 

There were at least 202 alleged crimes in 2022, the highest since 2018. There have been 96 incidents so far in 2023. I did not include Coors Field and focused instead on the area surrounding the shooting early Tuesday morning. By crime type: It is likely that multiple charges occurred at each incident, so a variety of alleged crimes could have happened at one incident.
